# Unicode

The files and scripts in this repo were used to
create the Unicode opener chars and brackets pod pages for
the [Raku docs](https://github.com/Raku/doc).

It was originally used with a **UCD.v10.0/** sub-directory obtained
from the Unicode Consortium's website.
(Note the directory is about 38 Mb in size
and thus is not included in this repo.)
It is now updated to v15.0.

See the zipped archives (**UCD.zip**) for download of version NN

See the shell script 'get-unicode-src.sh' for easy download.
