# Unicode

The files and scripts in this repo were used to
create the Unicode opener chars pod page for
the [Raku docs](https://github.com/Raku/doc).

It was originally used with a **UCD.v10.0/** sub-directory obtained
from the Unicode Consortium's website.
(Note the directory is about 38 Mb in size
and thus is not included in this repo.)

The pod table should probably be updated with the
latest version of Unicode (UCD.v13.0).
See [Unicode 13.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0).
